RGW Multisite
=============

Directions for configuring the RGW Multisite in ceph-ansible. Multisite can be configured either over multiple Ceph clusters or in a single Ceph cluster.

# Multiple Ceph Clusters

## Requirements

* At least 2 Ceph clusters
* 1 RGW per cluster
* Jewel or newer

More details:

* Can configure a Master and Secondary realm/zonegroup/zone on 2 separate clusters.

## Configuring the Master Zone in the Primary Cluster

This will setup the realm, zonegroup and master zone and make them the defaults.  It will also reconfigure the specified RGW for use with the zone.

``
1. Generate System Access and System Secret Keys

```
echo system_access_key: $(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 20 | head -n 1) > multi-site-keys.txt
echo system_secret_key: $(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 40 | head -n 1) >> multi-site-keys.txt
```
2. Edit the all.yml in group_vars

```
copy_admin_key: true
# Enable Multisite support
rgw_multisite: true
rgw_zone: jupiter
rgw_zonemaster: true
rgw_zonedefault: true
rgw_zonesecondary: false
rgw_multisite_proto: "http"
rgw_multisite_endpoint_addr: "{{ ansible_fqdn }}"
rgw_zonegroup: solarsystem
rgw_zonegroupmaster: true
rgw_zonegroupdefault: true
rgw_zone_user: zone.user
rgw_realm: milkyway
system_access_key: 6kWkikvapSnHyE22P7nO
system_secret_key: MGecsMrWtKZgngOHZdrd6d3JxGO5CPWgT2lcnpSt
```

**Note:** `rgw_zonemaster` should have the value of `true` and `rgw_zonesecondary` should be `false`

**Note:** replace the `system_access_key` and `system_secret_key` values with the ones you generated

**Note:** `ansible_fqdn` domain name assigned to `rgw_multisite_endpoint_addr` must be resolvable from the secondary Ceph clusters mon and rgw node(s)

**Note:** `rgw_zonegroupmaster` specifies the zonegroup will be the master zonegroup in a realm. There can only be one master zonegroup in a realm. This variable is set to true by default in group_vars/all.yml since only 1 zonegroup will be created if `rgw_zonegroup` is the same accross all rgw hosts in the inventory.

**Note:** `rgw_zonegroupdefault` specifies that the zonegroup will be the default zonegroup in a realm. If a zonegroup is default that means it is the only zonegroup in a realm. This variable is set to true by default in group_vars/all.yml since only 1 zonegroup will be created if `rgw_zonegroup` is the same accross all rgw hosts in the inventory.

**Note:** `rgw_zonedefault` specifies that the zonegroup will be the default zone in a cluster. If a zone is default that means it is the only zone in a realm in a cluster. This variable is set to true by default in group_vars/all.yml since only 1 zone will be created if `rgw_zone` is the same accross all rgw hosts in the inventory.

3. Run the ceph-ansible playbook on your 1st cluster

## Configuring the Secondary Zone in a Separate Cluster

4. Edit the all.yml in group_vars

```
copy_admin_key: true
# Enable Multisite support
rgw_multisite: true
rgw_zone: mars
rgw_zonemaster: false
rgw_zonedefault: true
rgw_zonesecondary: true
rgw_multisite_proto: "http"
rgw_multisite_endpoint_addr: "{{ ansible_fqdn }}"
rgw_zonegroup: solarsystem
rgw_zonegroupmaster: true
rgw_zonegroupdefault: true
rgw_zone_user: zone.user
rgw_realm: milkyway
system_access_key: 6kWkikvapSnHyE22P7nO
system_secret_key: MGecsMrWtKZgngOHZdrd6d3JxGO5CPWgT2lcnpSt
rgw_pull_proto: http
rgw_pull_port: 8080
rgw_pullhost: cluster0-rgw0
```

**Note:** `rgw_zonemaster` should have the value of `false` and `rgw_zonesecondary` should be `true`

**Note:** `rgw_pullhost` should be the `rgw_multisite_endpoint_addr` of the RGW that is configured in the Primary Cluster

**Note:** `rgw_zone_user`, `system_access_key`, and `system_secret_key` should match what you used in the Primary Cluster

**Note:** `ansible_fqdn` domain name assigned to `rgw_multisite_endpoint_addr` must be resolvable from the Primary Ceph clusters mon and rgw node(s)

**Note:** `rgw_zonedefault` is still set to true here since only 1 zone being created on the 2nd cluster. Even though there is only 1 realm in this deployment (galaxy), mars can still be a default zone because it is the only zone on the 2nd cluster.


5. Run the ceph-ansible playbook on your 2nd cluster

## Conclusion

You should now have a master zone on cluster0 and a secondary zone on cluster1 in an Active-Active mode.

# A Single Ceph
